Liferay’s Report admin portlet is not user-friendly because in this portlet, Uploading defination (jrxml file) to download report we have to navigate different pages.
In Liferay’s Report admin portlet we have to add parameter like key and type manually so it will be prone to errors.
In Liferay’s Report admin portlet all definitions are not visible to based on permissions.

Solution

Jasper report plug-in is configurable in which you can choose definition based on role’s view permission.Parameters will be fetched automatically from the jrxml file and it will generate input elements based on selected jrxml so we don’t have to add key and type of parameters manually.Jasper report plug-in is user-friendly because from single page we can generate, download and Preview report.Jasper report plug-in is accessible to any user so only admin needs to add definitions(jrxml) from Liferay Report Admin Portlet.
